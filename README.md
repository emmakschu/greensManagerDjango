GreensManager Suite
===================

This is a collection of Django web
apps to aid turfgrass managers,
in particular golf course 
superintendents, in tracking work
and data.

The generic edition will be 
released under the Apache 2.0 
License, while any changes 
tailored to a specific
facility (e.g if a golf course
should wish to include their own
logos, etc) will be their 
property.

The dev/sample version uses
SQLite3 for the database, but it
is highly recommended that any
deployment use a more advanced
relational database, with MariaDB
being the author's recommendation.

Still in alpha version, more info
will come later
